<div class="static">My Background</div>


<p>I was born in Mexico and grew up in Orange County, California.
  I moved to Aurora, Colorado just a few months ago for a new adventure.
I have very little experince in technology, but I have a math background, so
I'm hopeful that I can adapt the skills I have to be successful in this course!</p>


<p>While in California, I taught high school math for five years, coached our school's
tennis team for six years, and volunteered for a non-profit tennis association for
eleven years. Math and tennis are a huge part of who I am.</p>

<div class="static">Let Me Share Something With You</div>


<p>Being a math geek at heart, I absolutely must take this opportunity to show you some
cool, yet simple, math theorems and problems, as well as two mathematicians you may not know about:</p>

<p>And, since I know that some of you get really anxious at the thought of math, let
  me relief some of that tension by showing you a compilation of funny tennis moments: </p>

<div class="static">My Time in the Classroom and Technology</div>

    <p>My time in the classroom really influenced my perspective on technology.</p>

    <p>Teenagers generally love playing with technology, so they taught me a thing or two
    about it. They truly are very bright and pick up new ideas very quickly if given
    the chance to explore; when technology was involved, I didn't even have to ask them
    to explore! </p>

    <p>As we try to teach 21st century learners and our future labor force, it is VITAL
      that we teach students the technological skills they need to be successful in our
      current market. Learning how to use their cell phones and how to navigate
    the Internet are necessary, but it is only the beginning.</p>

    <p> It is of the utmost importance that we all have digital literacy! Not all of us
    have to be web designers or software engineers, but we all need to have some background
    on these topics to make ourselve competitive in the workforce. </p>

    <p>A college graduate once shared a story that has stuck with me for years--
    he was hired to do data entry. As a STEM major, he couldn't keep up with the fast
    paced typing of the English majors that were working for the company. Instead
    of trying to out-type them, he used his coding knowledge. He wrote a script
    that did his data entry job for him. Within a month or so, the others were
    let go, he was asked to get other STEM majors on board, and he built a great relationship
    with his boss that continues to have a positive effect on his career. </p>

    <p id="KeyPoint">I repeat and highlight: it is VITAL that we teach students the
      technological skills they need to be successful in our current market. Possessing
      some coding knowledge is something that no one can afford to lack. STEM major or not,
      we all need to have this type of digital literacy. </p>
